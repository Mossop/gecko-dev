  <h2>What's new on</h2>
  <h1>Pro Client</h1>
  <h3>March 8, 2022</h3>
  <h4>Stay on task with more accurate timestamps</h4>
  <p>Upcoming calendar event cards now have more precise timestamps, so you’ll know exactly when your next meeting starts.

  <h4>Keep tabs on upcoming and ongoing events</h4>
  <p>We’ve removed the timing countdown on event cards to reduce stress. With more natural language like “up next” and “almost over,” move seamlessly between meetings.

  <h4>A more delightful, on-brand search dropdown</h4>
  <p>With new colors, layout, and type on the search dropdown, the visual identity of Pro Client is continuing to evolve towards a more calming, flow-like experience.
