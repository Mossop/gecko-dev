  <h2>What's new on</h2>
  <h1>Pro Client</h1>
  <h3>April 11, 2022</h3>
  <h4>Updated Pro Client Logo Assets</h4>
  <p>We’ve made some tweaks to Pro Client’s logo so you can always find Pro Client amongst your applications.</p>
  <h4>Improved Accessibility for Starting a Browsing Session</h4>
  <p>Pro Client’s home screen defaults focus to the URL bar so that you can quickly jump into search.
  In addition, Quick Actions now have focus states while navigating the search drop down with arrow keys.</p>
  <h4>Maintain your Firefox Account settings</h4>
  <p>We’ve updated settings and preferences so you can easily maintain your Firefox account section in your settings.</p>
  <h4>Seamlessly navigate with contextual search</h4>
  <p>You can now use contextual search to simplify your workload and find results that have greater relevance.
  With contextual search enabled, you can actively use the navigation bar to search within the website seamlessly.</p>
  <h4>Keep a pulse on active downloads</h4>
  <p>Keep track of your active downloads via status notifications at the bottom of the Companion.
  To view all previous downloads, use Command + J on Mac, and Control + J on Windows.</p>
