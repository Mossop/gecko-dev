  <h2>What's new on</h2>
  <h1>Pro Client</h1>
  <h3>February 28, 2022</h3>
  <h4>Meet Pro Client’s new logo</h4>
  <p>Inspired by a calming zen garden, our new logo delivers on the Pro Client promise to help you stay focused, productive, and in the flow.

  <h4>A clean, new toolbar with visual updates</h4>
  <p>We've just rolled out the next phase of Pro Client’s visual styling, bringing us one step closer to a calm, focused end-to-end product experience.

  <h4>More intelligent calendar cards in Companion</h4>
  <p>With advanced updates to Pro Client’s calendar integration, you are no longer able to see deleted meetings in your companion and can view all-day events in browse. If you have multiple calendars, you’ll no longer see upcoming event cards for any calendar you’ve turned off.
